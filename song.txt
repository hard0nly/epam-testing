[Verse 1]
Footsteps through the back door
I can hear them, right
This is not for everyone
But you ask for it
Flows like a golden shore
I can feel the burn
You kill me with your words
’cause I ask for it

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t deserve the blame
We had to walk that way
The roads that we rode down
We slow down for no one
But you ask for it
I wanna feel the pain
Our hearts intoxicated
Our minds frustrated
Storm like a hurricane

[Chorus]
All we do is go
Up, going up go down
Pull around, this is us, the usual
Wanderlust, running blind
Time is never on our side, the usual
When dark becomes light
The broken will rise
The usual
Up, up, going up, go down
Pull around, this is us, the usual

[Verse 2]
Voices in the hallway
Some whispers fill the rooms
Come to stay with me and you
’cause we ask for it
Smoke building in our lungs
And we just let it burn
That’s when all end of storm [?]
And we ask for it

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t deserve the blame
We had to walk that way
The roads that we rode down
We slow down for no one
But you ask for it
I wanna feel the pain
Our hearts intoxicated
Our minds frustrated
Storm like a hurricane

[Chorus]
All we do is go
Up, going up go down
Pull around, this is us, the usual
Wanderlust, running blind
Time is never on our side, the usual
When dark becomes light
The broken will rise
The usual
Up, up, going up, go down
Pull around, this is us, the usual

[Bridge]
Running in circles
Receivin’ no light
Don’t wanna hurt you
But this ain’t no lie
We walk the tight line
This time rocks
Wanna feelin’ we can
Runinn’ runnin’ runiin’

[Chorus]
All we do is go
Up, going up go down
Pull around, this is us, the usual
Wanderlust, running blind
Time is never on our side, the usual
When dark becomes light
The broken will rise
The usual
Up, up, going up, go down
Pull around, this is us, the usual
